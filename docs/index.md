# Welcome to Enscribe Documentation

This section of the documentation explains our frontend and primary backend microservices.

## Frontend

## Backend
The backend is a Django application that both serves the frontend and provides several API endpoints for the frontend to interact with (as Mentioned in the [API documentation](api.md)).
